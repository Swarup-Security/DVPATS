**DVPATS - Damn Vulnerable Product and Technical Specifications**

Have you ever found yourself questioning whether your AI-based threat modeling and design review tools are truly uncovering all the threats? Have you ever wanted a way to validate their effectiveness with real-world-like, documentation-driven inputs? If yes — you're in the right place.

**DVPATS** is an intentionally crafted set of insecure product and technical documentation designed for educational purposes. It simulates real-world product manuals, architecture diagrams, API specs, and technical overviews—all laced with embedded design flaws, insecure assumptions, and potential misconfigurations.

The goal of **DVPATS** is to help security learners, threat modelers, and developers practice the art of documentation-based threat modeling. By reviewing these flawed specs, users can learn how to spot vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle—before code is written or deployed—mirroring how attackers and security architects assess risks from publicly available or internal documentation.

DVPATS can be used to verify the automated threamodeling and design reviews by Agentic AI tools - With the advent of AI-based threat modeling and design review tools, there is a growing need for standardized, challenging benchmarks to evaluate their effectiveness. DVPATS serves as a testbed for these tools, allowing developers and researchers to assess how well automated systems can detect theoretical threats purely from documentation. Whether you're building an LLM-based threat detection engine or validating existing tools, DVPATS provides a consistent and realistic benchmark for testing performance and accuracy.
