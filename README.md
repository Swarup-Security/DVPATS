**DVPATS - Damn Vulnerable Product and Technical Specifications**


**DVPATS** is an intentionally crafted set of insecure product and technical documentation designed for educational purposes. It simulates real-world product manuals, architecture diagrams, API specs, and technical overviews—all laced with embedded design flaws, insecure assumptions, and potential misconfigurations.

The goal of **DVPATS** is to help security learners, threat modelers, and developers practice the art of documentation-based threat modeling. By reviewing these flawed specs, users can learn how to spot vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle—before code is written or deployed—mirroring how attackers and security architects assess risks from publicly available or internal documentation.
